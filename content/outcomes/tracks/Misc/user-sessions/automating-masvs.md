* The session has been focused on creating BDD tests to automated the OWASP MSTG test cases, in order to integrate those tests in the CI/CD pipeline*

## Outcomes/Deliverables

The main outcome of the working sessions is a set of BDD tests for Android and iOS, using the MSTG playground and iOS iGoat as target apps. The repo with the developed tests cabn be found here. 

[Automation of MASVS with BDD](https://github.com/ing-bank/bdd-mobile-security-automation-framework/)

## Synopsis and Takeaways (recommend)

We want to create a complete set of BDD tests, that will automate the OWASP MASVS. At the moment the BDD tests have been created using Calaba.sh as a third party framework, but the goal is to provide multiple solutions using also native frameworks

## Identified Questions

* Do we need an external framework (Appium, TestNG, Espresso), or is it better to create native tests?
* Which third party tools do we need to expand the test cases (Frida ,Drozer etc)?

## Important Conclusions
* Develop new BDD tests following the MSTG is the way to go
* Next activities:
  * Explore native solutions (iOS and Android) to write BDD tests
  * Expand the current tests
